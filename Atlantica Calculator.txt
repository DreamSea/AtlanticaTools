Todo: 


DONE 2014/03/14 Basic craftsinto Panel
DONE 2014/03/11 Sum of Craft costs
DONE 2014/03/11 Ratio of Profit/WL: currently as total size, redo to individual prices

***Split item panel into craft/material panel and item detail panel

public/private messups probably due to pass by value/reference shenanigans
to patch later

return list of best profit ratios of everything
return list of best profit ratio by maxworkload

profit ratio by materials in item panel

timestamp price changes
keep a log of price changes (oh man)

may eventually want to in/output object streams to load/save

~~~

Possible problems:

//How to deal with initial craft load (possible null returns from itemMap)
	Current version: possible things added to material if unfound
	fix: delete material and recreate properly? may have to transfer craftinto array
