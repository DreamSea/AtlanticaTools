Todo: 

DONE 2014/03/15 (MED) move worth from craftcomponentpanel into iteminfopanel, added autocraft[i]
DONE 2014/03/14 (HIGH) Split item panel into craft/material panel and item detail panel
DONE 2014/03/13 (HIGH) Basic craftsinto Panel
DONE 2014/03/11 (HIGH) Sum of Craft costs
DONE 2014/03/11 (HIGH) Ratio of Profit/WL: currently as total size, redo to individual prices

(HIGH) fix item initial load

(MED) add color to craftTable, light green background for ratio > 1? bold text for ratio > 3?
(MED) add craft books for workload prices

(LOW+) profit ratio by materials in item panel
(LOW+) timestamp price changes

(LOW) return list of best profit ratios of everything
(LOW) return list of best profit ratio by maxworkload
(LOW) object streams for save/load
(LOW) change gui to be based on window size/variables, change layout from border to something else

(LOW-) log of price changes for items

(forever) add recipes
(forever) make the code less ugly, figure out public/private
(forever) comment more.
(forever) probably needless number of strings/objects created and garbage collected at the moment

~~~

Possible problems:

//How to deal with initial craft load (possible null returns from itemMap)
	Current version: possible things added to material if unfound
	fix: delete material and recreate properly? may have to transfer craftinto array

//public/private messups probably due to pass by value/reference shenanigans
to patch later
