Todo:

(Internal  MED+) figure out how to set up a test class/method
(Misc.     MED+) move recipes into separate file and redo loading method so that it's easier to make changes

(Internal  MED) Am I discarding a bunch of CraftBuilder objects everywhere?
(Internal  MED) figure out way to automate/whatever craftTable colors (pass array of arrays?)

(Ext.Front MED-) eldest component update = max(focus'd item + recipe items)
(Ext.Front MED-) return list of best profit ratios of everything
(Ext.Front MED-) return list of best profit ratio by maxworkload
(Internal  MED-) Consider DefaultListModel for craftintopanel.java
(Misc.     MED-) setter in GUIManager for all the colors in different gui panels

(Internal  LOW) object streams for save/load
(Ext.Front LOW) gui to allow putting in new items through program
(Misc.     LOW) change gui to be based on window size/variables, change layout from border to something else
(Ext.Back  LOW) better Item.toString()?

(Ext.Front LOW-) log of price changes for items
(Ext.Front LOW-) weird things can happen when messing around with keyboard directional keys

(Misc.) add recipes
(Misc.) make the code less ugly, figure out public/private, less public static
(Misc.) comment more.
(Misc.) probably needless number of strings/objects created and garbage collected at the moment

(???) currently entering recipes by hand = many chances to make a mistake...
		try putting all the recipes into various xmls/database type things outside of java?
(???) eliminate typecasting, use TreeMap<String, Material> and TreeMap<String, Craftable>?
		make sure to check for workbook that isnt in material. hard to do because casting
		things in craftedFrom arrays where everything stored as item.
~~~

Probable things slowing down program most:
ColorRenderer.java for CraftIntopanel.java

Not sure if there is any point in using a RecipeIterator over a set of
getStuff() methods. Also currently not making any copies for the
Iterators, but pretty sure there shouldn't be any changes to the lists
while iterating.

~~~

Possible problems:

What if there is a craft book that needs to be converted into a craftable?

//How to deal with initial craft load (possible null returns from itemMap)
	Current version: possible things added to material if unfound
	fix: delete material and recreate properly? may have to transfer craftinto array

//public/private messups probably due to pass by value/reference shenanigans
to patch later

2014/05/04 (Ext.Front MED)	Basic deck layout to allow for future switching between tools
2014/05/01 (Ext.Back  MED)	Starting console logging option to help look for what operations take the longest. Currently only logging through first constructor calls.

2014/04/27 (Internal  MED)	Cleaned up ItemInfoPanel - broke up giant method, Enum HashMapKey 
2014/04/26 (Internal  ???)	Enum ItemType. Discarded original plan to eliminate type casting due to how craftedFromItems is an array of Items. Maybe in the future.

2014/04/09 (Bug Fix	  LOW)	fixed timestamps
2014/04/09 (Internal  MED)	boolean ___changed
2014/04/07 (Internal  MED+)	cleanup/comment/planning: model package, event
2014/04/02 (Internal  MED+)	cleanup/comment/planning: Manager, gui package
2014/03/30 (Internal  MED-)	GRAND REFACTORish. Information passed with listeners. Lots of cleanup to do though.

2014/03/20 (Ext.Front MED)	max wl, "updated # seconds ago"
2014/03/16 (Misc.     HIGH)	Fix initial item load, added craft tree for Auto-Craft[ii]
2014/03/15 (Misc.     MED)	Move worth from CraftComponentPanel into ItemInfoPanel, added Auto-Craft[i]
2014/03/14 (Ext.Front HIGH)	Split Item panel into craft/material panel and item detail panel
