Todo: 

DONE 2014/03/16 (HIGH) Fix initial item load, added craft tree for Auto-Craft[ii]
DONE 2014/03/15 (MED) Move worth from CraftComponentPanel into ItemInfoPanel, added Auto-Craft[i]
DONE 2014/03/14 (HIGH) Split Item panel into craft/material panel and item detail panel
DONE 2014/03/13 (HIGH) Basic CraftsInto Panel
DONE 2014/03/11 (HIGH) Sum of Craft costs
DONE 2014/03/11 (HIGH) Ratio of Profit/WL: currently as total size, redo to individual prices

(MED+) add craft books for workload prices, use menu selector to choose which workload to use

(MED) add max wl (aka most wl stacked up in one craft cycle)
(MED) add color to craftTable, light green background for ratio > 1? bold text for ratio > 3?

(LOW+) profit ratio by materials in item panel
(LOW+) timestamp price changes

(LOW) return list of best profit ratios of everything
(LOW) return list of best profit ratio by maxworkload
(LOW) object streams for save/load
(LOW) change gui to be based on window size/variables, change layout from border to something else

(LOW-) log of price changes for items

(forever) add recipes
(forever) make the code less ugly, figure out public/private, less public static
(forever) comment more.
(forever) probably needless number of strings/objects created and garbage collected at the moment

(???) currently entering recipes by hand = many chances to make a mistake...
		try putting all the recipes into various xmls/database type things outside of java?
~~~

Possible problems:

//How to deal with initial craft load (possible null returns from itemMap)
	Current version: possible things added to material if unfound
	fix: delete material and recreate properly? may have to transfer craftinto array

//public/private messups probably due to pass by value/reference shenanigans
to patch later
