(HIGH) TIMESTAMPS ARE BROKEN?? refreshes dateUpdated for next item selected in tree
			in addition to original item
			-Only breaks when changing price in ItemInfoPanel
			-Doesn't break if select folder in CraftItemTree before selecting another item
			

(MED+) craftable boolean costChanged for when components or selected craft book has changed
		calculate when getProfitRatio called

(MED) title labels in craftcomponentpanel
(MED) Consider DefaultListModel for craftintopanel
(MED) Consider builder helpers for item construction (.setType().addRecipe().addRecipe()...)
(MED) patch up tostring()

(MED) figure out how to set up a test class/method

(MED) title labels in craftcomponentpanel
(MED-) profit ratio by materials in craftcomponent panel
(MED-) more information in ItemInfoPanel
(MED-) add more information in menu bar selector for craft books (WL size? ratio?)

(MED-) add color to craftTable, light green background for ratio > 1? bold text for ratio > 3?

(LOW) return list of best profit ratios of everything
(LOW) return list of best profit ratio by maxworkload
(LOW) object streams for save/load
(LOW) change gui to be based on window size/variables, change layout from border to something else

(LOW-) log of price changes for items

(forever) add recipes
(forever) make the code less ugly, figure out public/private, less public static
(forever) comment more.
(forever) probably needless number of strings/objects created and garbage collected at the moment

(???) currently entering recipes by hand = many chances to make a mistake...
		try putting all the recipes into various xmls/database type things outside of java?
~~~

Possible problems:

What if there is a craft book that needs to be converted into a craftable?

//How to deal with initial craft load (possible null returns from itemMap)
	Current version: possible things added to material if unfound
	fix: delete material and recreate properly? may have to transfer craftinto array

//public/private messups probably due to pass by value/reference shenanigans
to patch later
