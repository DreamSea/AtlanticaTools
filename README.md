AtlanticaTools (AKA: I can't think up project names)
==============

Personal Project - Making up analysis doohickeys for Atlantica<br>

Started as a spreadsheet that I had to keep track of market prices and determine which crafts I could pursue for greatest profit/time. The main limitations to my spreadsheet (I didn't use macros) was piecing together how items interacted, as in if the price of one component would drop, then I would have to skim through the entire sheet to find which crafts would be influenced.<br>

The first portion/milestone of this "tool" is hopefully a cleaner way to compare related items.<br>

Additional "tools"... to be implemented once I've polished off the original goal.<br>
